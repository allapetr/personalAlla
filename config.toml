I am currently pursuing a Performer Diploma degree at the [Jacobs School of Music](https://music.indiana.edu) (US) and hold a Bachelor’s and Master's degree in Violin Performance from the [Royal Northern College of Music](https://www.rncm.ac.uk/) (UK). I am a prize winner in violin international competitions and give regular concerts in the UK and the US.<br/><br/>As a teacher, I have been working internationally for more than 7 years and have taught students of all levels and ages ranging between 5 and 65. I am experienced in delivering one-to-one classes and leading small and large ensembles as a private tutor. In addition, I collaborated with established educational programmes such as the RNCM Young Strings, the Manchester International Society and the Artis Education Programme in the UK, as well as the Antigua Music Camp in Antigua and Barbuda.<br/><br/>I approach my teaching with enthusiasm and tailor each lesson to my students’ preferences and needs. I love to guide my students through their learning journey and finding solutions to their struggles along the way gives me great satisfaction. Since 2015, I also train regularly in Dalcroze Eurhythmics, Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais and Kodály Methods, all of which help me provide a creative and body and mind friendly approach to my teaching.<br/><br/>For a full description of my performance and teaching experience please check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alla-petrichei-3380174a/) profile."
