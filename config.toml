Music education is my vocation and now I specialize in online teaching because I truly believe this is the most powerful way I can serve the world. My experience teaching many students of all ages and from many corners of the world has given me the ability not only to teach people how to play the violin and understand music, but also through music to empower students in their day to day life. My own education spanned over 20 years and 3 countries and it started in Romania where I was enrolled in vocational music education at the age of 7. From age 9 I started performing extensively at national festivals and won several prizes at national and international competitions. I completed my secondary education as a scholarship student in England at [St Peter’s School, York](https://www.stpetersyork.org.uk) and went on to complete both a Bachelor’s and Master's degrees in Violin Performance at the [Royal Northern College of Music](https://www.rncm.ac.uk/). To round off my education, I went on to pursue a Performer Diploma in Violin at the [Jacobs School of Music](https://music.indiana.edu) with the world-renowned pedagogues Mauricio Fuks and Stanley Ritchie. Throughout my carrier I have collaborated with established educational programmes in the US and the UK such as the RNCM Young Strings, the Manchester International Society and the Artis Education Programme, as well as the Antigua Music Camp in Antigua and Barbuda. I approach my teaching with great enthusiasm and give my all to solving my students' technical problems and to satisfying and nurturing their individual needs. My training in Dalcroze Eurhythmics, Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais and Kodály Methods make my teaching a holistic practice which focuses on both body and mind which has lasting benefits for students beyond our lessons."
