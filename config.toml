        content = "Hello! My name is Alla Petrichei and I dedicated most of my life to playing and teaching violin and music in general worldwide. Music education is my vocation and most recently I specialised in online education because I truly believe this is the most powerful way I can serve the world. My experience teaching thousands of students of many ages and from many corners of the world has given me the ability to not only teach anyone in any setting how to play the violin and understand music, but to also empower students in their day to day life through music. My own education spans over 20 years and 3 countries, Romania, the United Kingdom and the United States. I hold a Performer Diploma in Violin from the [Jacobs School of Music](https://music.indiana.edu) (US) as well as a Bachelor’s and Master's degrees in Violin Performance from the [Royal Northern College of Music](https://www.rncm.ac.uk/) (UK). Throughout my carrier I collaborated with established educational programmes in the United Stated and in the United Kingdom such as the RNCM Young Strings, the Manchester International Society and the Artis Education Programme, as well as the Antigua Music Camp in Antigua and Barbuda. I approach my teaching with great enthusiasm and I give my all to solve my students' struggles and to satisfy and nurture their individual needs. My training in Dalcroze Eurhythmics, Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais and Kodály Methods helped me transform my teaching into a holistic practice which focuses on both body and mind and has lasting benefits way outside the classroom."

As Alla Petrichei, the founder of Violin Plus, experienced in her own journey as a growing young musician it is very challenging for violin students from most places in the world to find mentors who have both the best technical and musical knowledge and a well-rounded approach to education centered on wellbeing. Violin Plus uses the growing access to the internet globally to connect students from all corners of the world who want to learn about music in a broader sense or to study the violin with an outstanding teacher who truly has her students' best interest at heart. There are no bounderies, so let's make the world a better place through music!"
