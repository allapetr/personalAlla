      "I like Alla's positive and calm approach to teaching. As well as identifying aspects of playing that could be improved, she is good at coming up with strategies to overcome the problem. Ever since I started studying with her, I have found playing in orchestra easier and been more confident."

      "Joining Alla's violin class was the best decision I made. She is an incredible, passionate and dedicated teacher. She always motivated and supported me as a beginner and was very patient. If you doubt registering with her, as her former student I would say: Go for it! She is the best!"
