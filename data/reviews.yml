      "I’ve been studying with Alla for five years and I cannot recommend her highly enough. She is passionate about the learning process and makes learning violin fun and enjoyable. My approach to playing has been totally transformed thanks to her. Most recently, Alla has given me tremendous support in achieving a Merit in my ABRSM Grade 5 Violin Practical exam and a Distinction in my Grade 5 Music Theory exam."

      "Feeling very fortunate! Alla has managed to create a safe, comfortable and highly positive space for my development with the violin. I never feel judged or as though my screeches and scratches are offensive in anyway. Thanks to Alla's mindful guidance, the screeches and scratches have become few and far between. Also, I am so grateful that she is easily able to incorporate theory into the lesson where and when it is needed, solidifying a long lasting foundation. She truly makes every step of the process fascinating and fun! Thank you Alla!"

      "I like Alla's positive and calm approach to teaching. As well as identifying aspects of playing that could be improved, she is good at coming up with strategies to overcome the problem. Ever since I started studying with her, I have found playing in orchestra easier and been more confident."

      "We have taken several lessons with Alla. She is a joy to work with. She is patient, observant, and personable. My child always looks forward to her lessons. She likes that she takes her time with her and not rush her even when she hasn’t quite gotten a song right. She also likes that they can laugh together."

      "Joining Alla's violin class was the best decision I made. She is an incredible, passionate and dedicated teacher. She always motivated and supported me as a beginner and was very patient. If you doubt registering with her, as her former student I would say: Go for it! She is the best!"

      "Alla was absolutely delightful for my son’s lesson and immediately put him at ease. She was extremely attentive and her instruction was efficient yet kind. She listened to our needs prior to the lesson and was creative in addressing them. His posture and overall movement with the instrument has already noticeably improved. Looking forward to more lessons with Alla."

      "It has been fun learning a variety of ear training and music theory fundamentals with Alla. The lessons have been varied and interesting and I really feel the lessons are customized to where I am at every week. She really makes good use of technology and zoom and I really appreciate the detail that Alla gives to questions. She is great at pulling up illustrative examples to explain things."
