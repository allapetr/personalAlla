      "I’ve been studying with Alla for five years and I cannot recommend her highly enough. She is passionate about the learning process and makes learning violin fun and enjoyable. My approach to playing has been totally transformed thanks to her. Most recently, Alla has given me tremendous support in achieving a Merit in my ABRSM Grade 5 Violin Practical exam and a Distinction in my Grade 5 Music Theory exam."

      "I like Alla's positive and calm approach to teaching. As well as identifying aspects of playing that could be improved, she is good at coming up with strategies to overcome the problem. Ever since I started studying with her, I have found playing in orchestra easier and been more confident."

      "Alla was absolutely delightful for my son’s lesson and immediately put him at ease. She was extremely attentive and her instruction was efficient yet kind. She listened to our needs prior to the lesson and was creative in addressing them. His posture and overall movement with the instrument has already noticeably improved. Looking forward to more lessons with Alla."

      "Cleaning up old habits. In order to launch into greater heights on the violin, I'm thankful for Alla's guidance or "spring cleaning". Alla continue to create fresh awareness which will benefit the big picture. Nipping issues in the bud before they become a chronic condition. Also, Alla has the ability make musical theory such a joy. I am looking forward to the next lesson. Thank you!"
